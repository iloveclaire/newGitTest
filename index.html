  		Today I created this website so that the day that we are a thing, you can actually look back at this website and see how much I love you. I love you with all my heart and I would not want it any other way. Never change yourself for anyone becasuse you are special, just the way you are. And the same Claire that I spoke to yesterday is the same Claire I will love tomorrow!

  		I will post something everyday, so check back tomorrow!
